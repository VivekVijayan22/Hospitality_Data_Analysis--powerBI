# Hospitality Analysis Challenge 


## Problem Statement
Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

## Key insights from Dashboard
1. Ratings Strongly Influence Occupancy
- Properties with lower average ratings (e.g., 2.3–2.5) have significantly lower occupancy rates (~44–49%).
- High-rated properties (ratings >4.0) consistently show occupancy rates above 60%, confirming that guests prioritize reviews before booking.
2. Occupancy Drives RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)
- A direct positive correlation exists between occupancy % and RevPAR.
- Properties with both high occupancy and good ratings tend to deliver better revenue performance.
3. ADR Is Flat – Static Pricing Strategy
- ADR (Average Daily Rate) remains nearly constant at ₹12,696 across all segments and weeks, indicating lack of dynamic pricing.
- This limits revenue optimization opportunities during high-demand periods.
4. Weekends Drive Higher Revenue
- On weekends:
  - sub-RevPAR increases (₹7,972 vs ₹7,083).
  - sub-Occupancy improves from 63% to 56% .
- Suggests weekend-focused promotions or pricing could be optimized further.
5. Direct Channels Underperform
- ADR from direct platforms (hotel's own booking platforms) is lower than other booking platforms.
6. Room Class Distribution
- Elite and Premium rooms generate the highest revenue (₹554M and ₹456M), suggesting these segments are in demand.
- Standard rooms bring the least (₹306M), but may still be critical for volume-based bookings.
7. City-wise Revenue Leader
- Mumbai leads in city-wise revenue (₹661M), followed by Bangalore (₹415M).
- Properties in Hyderabad and Delhi trail behind, despite similar room offerings—indicating regional differences in demand or pricing efficiency.
8. Cancellation Rates Are Moderate
- Average cancellation rate across properties is ~24.8%, with little variance.
- This level is manageable but may benefit from policies or incentives to reduce last-minute cancellations.

## Strategic Recommendations
- Implement dynamic pricing to optimize ADR based on demand.
- Focus on improving online ratings through service quality and post-stay feedback management.
- Consider channel-specific offers to improve performance of direct bookings.
- Promote high-performing room classes (Elite/Premium) and cities (like Mumbai) during peak travel periods.
